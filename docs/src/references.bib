  abstract = {A constitutive model is developed that is capable of predicting deformation and failure in ductile materials. The parameters for the model can be determined by simple tension and compression tests on the material of interest. This plasticity/failure model is implemented into explicit Lagrangian finite element codes. Examples are presented showing that the model can predict ductile failure mechanisms, as benchmarked by carefully planned experiments duplicating real world problems.},

  abstract = {A state variable model for describing the finite-deformation behavior of metals is proposed. A multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic, volumetric plastic (damage), and deviatoric plastic parts is considered. With respect to the natural or stress-free configuration defined by this decomposition, the thermodynamics of the state variable theory is investigated. This model incorporates train rate and temperature sensitivity, as well as damage, through a yield surface approach in which the state variables follow a hardening minus-recovery format. The microstructural underpinnings of the model are presented along with a detailed description of the effects with each model parameter has on the predicted response. Issues associated with implementation of this model into finite element codes are also discussed. The model has been applied in finite element simulation of several manufacturing processes. These include the prediction of anisotropy in hydroforming applications, metal cutting, and high temperature applications such as forging and welding. In each case, experiments are well described by predictions based on this model.},

In particular we address both the method of determining the parameters of the model and the engineering meaning of the parameters in terms of uniaxial stress-strain curves. The ability of the model to predict some aspects of anisotropic hardening, strain rate history effects, and thermal softening are then illustrated by comparison with experimental data.},

After employing a method developed by Coleman and Noll to find the general restrictions which the Clausius-Duhem inequality places on response functions, we analyze various types of dynamical stability that can be exhibited by solutions of the internal evolution equations. We also discuss integral dissipation inequalities, conditions under which temperatures can be associated with internal states, and the forms taken by response functions when the material is a fluid.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a constitutive model and data for materials subjected td large strains, high strain rates and high temperatures. The basic form of the model is well suited for computations because it uses variables which are readily available in most of the applicable computer codes. The materials considered are OFHC copper, Cartridge brass, Nickel 200, Armco iron, Carpenter electrical iron, 1006 steel, 2024-T351 aluminum, 7039 aluminum, 4340 steel, S-7 tool steel, Tungsten alloy and DU*.75Ti (depleted uranium). The data for the material constants are obtained from torsion tests over a wide range of strain rates, static tensile tests, dynamic Hopkinson bar tensile tests and Hopkinson bar teats at elevated temperatures. The model and data are evaluated by comparing computational results with data from cylinder impact tests.},

A strainrate vector of arbitrary direction, but constant in time, is imposed for an arbitrary duration on a material with an arbitrary initial stress state. An exact solution is presented and then used to compare the accuracy of three commonly used numerical methods. The simplistic radial return method is found to have reasonable single step accuracy. It is recommended for moderate accuracy requirements and the exact method for higher accuracy. The multistep error estimator based on the magnitude of the deviatoric trial stress is shown to be bad and a better estimator presented for the secant stiffness method.},
