# OptimizationBCJPlasticityExt

```@meta
CurrentModule = Base.get_extension(BammannChiesaJohnsonPlasticity, :OptimizationBCJPlasticityExt)
```

This extension is meant to provide additional functionality to the base package with the intent of performing optimization studies with the [`Optimization.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/Optimization.jl.git) and [`LossFunctions.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaML/LossFunctions.jl.git) packages to calibrate material model constants against experimental data.
