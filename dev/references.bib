  abstract = {We review the development of a strain rate and temperature dependent plasticity model for finite deformation. In particular we address both the method of determining the parameters of the model and the engineering meaning of the parameters in terms of uniaxial stress-strain curves. The ability of the model to predict some aspects of anisotropic hardening, strain rate history effects, and thermal softening are then illustrated by comparison with experimental data.},

  abstract = {A constitutive model is developed that is capable of predicting deformation and failure in ductile materials. The parameters for the model can be determined by simple tension and compression tests on the material of interest. This plasticity/failure model is implemented into explicit Lagrangian finite element codes. Examples are presented showing that the model can predict ductile failure mechanisms, as benchmarked by carefully planned experiments duplicating real world problems.},
