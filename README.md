This repository serves two primary purposes:
1. The codes necessary for the Julian-implementation of the package, and
2. Data from publications such that selected works might be replicated and their implementation demonstrated.

Currently, only that model from [Cho et. al. (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749641918303139) is implemented here.
