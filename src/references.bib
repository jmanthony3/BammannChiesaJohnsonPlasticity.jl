  abstract = {We review the development of a strain rate and temperature dependent plasticity model for finite deformation. In particular we address both the method of determining the parameters of the model and the engineering meaning of the parameters in terms of uniaxial stress-strain curves. The ability of the model to predict some aspects of anisotropic hardening, strain rate history effects, and thermal softening are then illustrated by comparison with experimental data.},
